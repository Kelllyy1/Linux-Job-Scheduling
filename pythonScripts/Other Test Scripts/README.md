## These are some other scripts that made my life easier

# Senior Design Script
For our senior design script we were tasked initially with deciding on a project idea. Once we agreed on the idea as a group, it was our task to do reconaissance with previous groups to get ideas on ways to implement our project. The structure of our senior design website was a bit tedious/time consuming to traverse so I designed a Python Script to make it easier to maneuver through the different group websites.

I noticed that each link was the same pattern with the exception of the number identifying the group at the end of the link, so I made a script with the base URL and a for loop to produce clickable links to the screen. This made it much easier to traverse different group websites in a timely manner.

# Test Python
This was one of my first experiments with API usage, web scraping, and JSON parsing. I scraped data from publicly available API(s).
